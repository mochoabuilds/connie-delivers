# Pedicab App

## WHAT

* Ride-sharing app for Chicago's ~200 pedicab drivers and the public

## WHY

* A healthy economy can only exist in symbiosis with a healthy ecology. Sustainable growth on the neighborhood level requires an ability to repair our ecosystems.  This app capitalizes on this by serving as a bridge between technology and conversation as public opinion on pedicab services shifts.
